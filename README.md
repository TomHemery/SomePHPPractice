This is <i>definitely</i> the <i>most impressive</i> repo in git history.

No... but I need to get better at web dev and this is me doing that? I hope.

For now this isn't really something worth cloning, I just need to move code between my laptop and desktop, but I will eventually add the other stuff to this repo needed to be able to easily set it up... once it's worth running. For that reason there isn't any form of version control for the database right now (it's literally a table called fruit that I just push random data in to).
